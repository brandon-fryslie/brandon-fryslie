## 🐚 rad-shell — The Flagship

**★ 41 stars • 7 forks • Thousands of daily users • Years of evolution**

This is what **sustained commitment** looks like. Not a weekend hack. A complete Zsh framework that developers worldwide install, trust, and use daily.

**Built over years with obsessive attention to:**
- ⚡ **Performance**: Millisecond startup times, not seconds
- 🎨 **Design**: Git-aware theming with visual intelligence
- 🔌 **Architecture**: Plugin system that actually extends without breaking
- 📦 **Reliability**: Battle-tested in production environments across continents

**The Ecosystem:**
- **[rad-plugins](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/rad-plugins)** — Extensible plugin architecture that works
- **[git-taculous-zsh-theme](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/git-taculous-zsh-theme)** — Where the journey started
- **[dotfiles](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/dotfiles)** — Personal config maintained since day one

**This is the difference between a project and a commitment.**

When you commit to something for years—really commit—it shows. rad-shell has been refined, optimized, battle-tested, and trusted by thousands. It's not about the star count. It's about building something people actually **use** and **rely on**.

## 🤖 AI/ML — Real Integration, Real Problems

Not building ChatGPT wrappers. Building **real integration** that solves **human problems**.

### [macos-tts-via-openai](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/macos-tts-via-openai)
**OpenAI-powered screen reader you'd actually want to listen to.** Deep macOS accessibility integration with natural voice synthesis. This is AI serving humans, not performing tricks.

Real accessibility. Real integration. Real impact.

`Python` `OpenAI API` `macOS Accessibility` `Natural Voice Synthesis`

### [kalider](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/kalider)
**Experimental AI research at the edges.** *"It might not be a good idea, but it's an idea!"* 

Innovation requires trying things that might fail. This explores those boundaries. Not every experiment succeeds—but every experiment teaches.

`Python` `Machine Learning` `Experimental Research`

### [ptytest](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/ptytest)
**Terminal emulation testing infrastructure.** AI tools need solid foundations. This provides PTY testing for building robust CLI applications.

Because even AI needs Unix fundamentals.

## 🌐 Full-Stack — The Complete Picture

### [tesseract-react](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/tesseract-react)
Modern React with clean architecture. Not following framework-of-the-week. Building with **intention and vision**.

### [ember-rest.coffee](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/ember-rest.coffee) ⭐ 4
**Early Ember.js adoption with CoffeeScript REST utilities.** Built when these were **cutting edge**, not legacy. Shows commitment to exploring new paradigms when they're still risky bets.

Early adoption matters. It shows you're not just following—you're exploring.

### [sake](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/sake)
**WebSockets Made Easy.** Real-time communication with clean abstractions. Built before WebSockets were everywhere—when they were still hard.

### [storyportal-web-client](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/storyportal-web-client)
**Interactive web storytelling platform.** Technology should enable **creativity**, not just CRUD applications.

---

## 🎨 IoT & Hardware — Physical Computing

### [esp-bloom](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/esp-bloom)
**Ambient bias lighting using ESP8266 microcontrollers.** Inspired by ScreenBloom, rebuilt with custom features, extended capabilities. Dynamic colors, screen synchronization, custom patterns.

Real hardware. Real challenges. Real photons.

`Python` `ESP8266` `IoT` `LED Control` `Real-time Sync` `Hardware Integration`

### [pb-sync](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/pb-sync)
**PixelBlaze LED controller integration.** Clean TypeScript tooling for hardware control. Robust API design, hardware control done right.

`TypeScript` `Hardware APIs` `LED Controllers` `System Integration`

**Software is more than web apps.** Sometimes you need to control the physical world—lights, sensors, microcontrollers. That requires a different kind of thinking.

---

## 📚 Framework Development — Deep Knowledge

### [Smoke](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/Smoke) ⭐ 4
**A complete reinterpretation of CodeIgniter 2.0.2.** Not a fork—a **fundamental rethinking** of what a PHP framework could be.

Built in **2011** when I was exploring the deep fundamentals of MVC architecture, routing, and framework design. This is where you learn what frameworks **really are** beneath the surface.

`PHP` `MVC Architecture` `Framework Design` `2011` `Fundamentals`

### [combine](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/combine)
**PHP asset combination and minification.** Built **before asset pipelines were standard**. Before Webpack. Before the tooling explosion.

**Solving problems before the industry caught up.**

`PHP` `Asset Pipeline` `Build Tools` `Pre-Webpack Era`
