## �� Philosophy in Code

<div align="center">

![Philosophy](./assets/philosophy.svg)

</div>

I don't chase frameworks. I **master fundamentals**. Each project here represents sustained commitment—not weekend experiments, but years of evolution, thousands of commits, and code that people actually use.

```javascript
const approach = {
    depth: "Years, not weekends",
    proof: "rad-shell: 41★, thousands of users, still growing",
    range: "2011-2026 • PHP → JS → Python → AI → IoT",
    philosophy: "If you're green, you're growing",
    reality: "70+ repos, but only the meaningful ones here"
};
```

## 🐚 rad-shell — The Flagship

**★ 41 stars | 7 forks | Thousands of daily users**

This is what happens when you commit to something beyond a weekend hack. A complete Zsh framework built over **years**, trusted by developers worldwide.

**What makes it different:**
- ⚡ **Performance-obsessed**: Millisecond startup times
- 🎨 **Git-aware theming**: Visual intelligence, not just decoration
- 🔌 **True plugin architecture**: Extensible without breaking
- 📦 **Battle-tested**: Production environments, not just demos

**The ecosystem:**
- **[rad-plugins](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/rad-plugins)** — Plugin architecture that actually works
- **[git-taculous-zsh-theme](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/git-taculous-zsh-theme)** — Where it all started
- **[dotfiles](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/dotfiles)** — Personal config, maintained since day one

This is the difference between a project and a **commitment**.

## 🤖 AI/ML — Building Real Integration

Not writing ChatGPT wrappers. Building **actual integration** that solves human problems.

### [macos-tts-via-openai](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/macos-tts-via-openai)
**OpenAI-powered screen reader you'd actually want to listen to.** Deep macOS accessibility integration with natural voice synthesis. AI serving humans, not the reverse.

`Python` `OpenAI API` `macOS Integration` `Accessibility`

### [kalider](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/kalider)
**Experimental AI research.** *"It might not be a good idea, but it's an idea!"* Innovation requires trying things that might fail. This is that thing.

`Python` `Machine Learning` `Experimental`

### [ptytest](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/ptytest)
**Terminal emulation testing infrastructure.** Because AI tools still need solid foundations. PTY testing for robust CLI applications.

`Python` `Terminal Emulation` `Testing`

## 🌐 Full-Stack Development

### [tesseract-react](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/tesseract-react)
Modern React with clean architecture. Not following framework-of-the-week. Building with **intention**.

### [ember-rest.coffee](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/ember-rest.coffee) ⭐ 4
**Early Ember.js adoption with CoffeeScript.** Built when these were cutting edge, not legacy. Shows commitment to exploring new paradigms when they're still risky.

## 🎨 IoT & Hardware — Physical Computing

### [esp-bloom](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/esp-bloom)
**Ambient bias lighting with ESP8266.** Inspired by ScreenBloom, rebuilt with custom features. Dynamic colors, screen sync, custom patterns. Real hardware, real challenges.

### [pb-sync](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/pb-sync)
**PixelBlaze LED controller integration.** TypeScript tooling for hardware control. Clean API, robust implementation, hardware control done right.

`TypeScript` `Hardware` `API Design` `LED Controllers`

Software is more than web apps. Sometimes you need to **control photons**.

---

## 📚 Framework Development — Deep Knowledge

### [Smoke](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/Smoke) ⭐ 4
**A complete reinterpretation of CodeIgniter.** Not a fork—a **rethinking** of PHP framework architecture. Built in **2011** when I was exploring fundamentals.

`PHP` `MVC Architecture` `Framework Design` `2011`

### [combine](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/combine)
**Asset combination and minification.** Built before asset pipelines were standard. **Solving problems before the industry caught up.**

## 🎯 What Sets This Apart

**Most profiles are resume dumps. This is a portfolio of commitment.**

- ✅ **Sustained impact**: rad-shell with 41★ and thousands of users
- ✅ **Chronological depth**: 2011-2026, not just recent trends
- ✅ **Early adoption**: Smoke & Ember when they were **risky bets**
- ✅ **Full spectrum**: Frameworks → Full-Stack → AI → IoT → Hardware
- ✅ **Real usage**: Tools people actually use, not just demos
- ✅ **Deep understanding**: Framework architecture, not just API calls

This isn't a collection of weekend projects. It's a **body of work** spanning a decade.

## 💼 Open for Collaboration

Building the next generation of:

- 🤖 **AI/ML Systems** — Real integration solving real problems
- 🛠️ **Developer Tools** — Tools developers actually want to use
- 🏗️ **System Architecture** — Scaling with intention, not just cargo cult patterns
- 🚀 **Innovation** — Creating, not just following

I don't follow trends. I **investigate** them, **understand** them, **build** on them.
