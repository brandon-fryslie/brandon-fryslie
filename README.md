### *"If you're green, you're growing. If you're ripe, you're rotten."*

</div>

```javascript
// This isn't a resume. It's a decade.
const decade = {
    started: 2011,
    current: 2026,
    projects: 70+,
    meaningful: "Only what matters",
    
    flagship: {
        name: "rad-shell",
        stars: 41,
        users: "thousands daily",
        status: "still evolving"
    },
    
    philosophy: "Master fundamentals. Build with intention. Commit for years.",
    reality: "Not chasing frameworks. Creating foundations."
};

// Ten years of commits don't lie.

## 🐚 rad-shell: When Commitment Becomes Legend

**★ 41 | 👥 Thousands | ⚡ 10+ Years | 🌍 Worldwide**

This is what happens when you don't give up.

Most developers: Build something cool, get bored, move on.  
**Me**: Build something cool, commit for a decade, watch thousands of developers rely on it daily.

**rad-shell** isn't a project. It's a **commitment incarnate**.

- ⚡ **Performance obsession**: Millisecond startup when others take seconds
- 🎨 **Visual intelligence**: Git-aware theming that actually helps you work
- 🔌 **True extensibility**: Plugin architecture that doesn't break
- 🌍 **Global impact**: Developers on every continent trust this daily
- 📦 **Battle-proven**: Production environments, not just demos
- 💚 **Still growing**: Because ripe means rotten

**The Ecosystem**:
- **[rad-plugins](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/rad-plugins)** — Architecture that actually works
- **[git-taculous-zsh-theme](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/git-taculous-zsh-theme)** — Where the journey began
- **[dotfiles](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/dotfiles)** — A decade of refinement

When you use rad-shell, you're not using "some guy's dotfiles." You're using a **framework** refined over **ten years** by someone who **never stopped caring**.

That's the difference.

## 🤖 AI/ML: Solving Problems That Matter

Everyone's building ChatGPT wrappers.  
I'm building **actual integration** that **actual humans** need.

### [macos-tts-via-openai](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/macos-tts-via-openai)
**The screen reader you'd actually want to listen to.**

Natural voice synthesis. Deep macOS integration. Accessibility that doesn't sound like a robot reading tax forms.

This is AI **serving** humans, not performing tricks for demos.

`Python` `OpenAI` `macOS Accessibility` `Real Impact`

### [kalider](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/kalider)
**Experimental AI research. The kind that might fail.**

*"It might not be a good idea, but it's an idea!"*

Innovation requires trying things that might not work. This is one of those things. No apologies.

`Python` `Machine Learning` `Experimental` `Boundary-Pushing`

### [ptytest](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/ptytest)
**Because AI tools need Unix fundamentals.**

Terminal emulation. PTY testing. The unglamorous infrastructure that makes everything else possible.

`Python` `PTY` `Terminal Emulation` `Infrastructure`

## 🌐 Full-Stack: Built When It Mattered

### [tesseract-react](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/tesseract-react)
Modern React with clean architecture. Built with **intention**, not hype.

### [ember-rest.coffee](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/ember-rest.coffee) ⭐ 4
**Built in 2014 when Ember was cutting edge.**

Not legacy. **Early adoption.** Shows I explore new territory when it's still risky.

### [sake](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/sake)
**WebSockets Made Easy**. Built before they were everywhere—when they were still **hard**.

### [storyportal-web-client](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/storyportal-web-client)
Interactive storytelling platform. Because technology should enable **creativity**, not just CRUD.

---

## 🎨 IoT/Hardware: Software Meets Photons

### [esp-bloom](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/esp-bloom)
**Ambient bias lighting with ESP8266 microcontrollers.**

Inspired by ScreenBloom. Rebuilt better. Extended further.  
Dynamic colors. Screen sync. Custom patterns.

**Real hardware. Real challenges. Real photons.**

`Python` `ESP8266` `IoT` `LED Control` `Real-time Sync`

### [pb-sync](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/pb-sync)
**PixelBlaze LED controller integration.**

TypeScript. Hardware APIs. Clean abstractions.

Software isn't just web apps. Sometimes you need to **control the physical world**.

`TypeScript` `Hardware` `System Integration` `LED Controllers`

## 📚 Framework Development: Deep Knowledge, 2011

### [Smoke](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/Smoke) ⭐ 4
**Not a fork. A rethinking.**

Built in **2011** when I wanted to understand **what frameworks really are** beneath the surface.

Complete reinterpretation of CodeIgniter. MVC architecture explored from first principles.

This is where you learn frameworks aren't magic—they're **patterns you can understand and rebuild**.

`PHP` `MVC` `Architecture` `2011` `First Principles`

### [combine](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/combine)
**Asset combination and minification. Before Webpack existed.**

Solved problems **before** the industry caught up.

`PHP` `Build Tools` `Pre-Webpack` `Problem Solving`

## 🛠️ Developer Tools: Built on One Principle

**If I wouldn't use it every day, why should anyone else?**

- **[handy-debugger](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/handy-debugger)** — Node.js debugging without the pain
- **[stacker](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/stacker)** — Boot your entire dev stack correctly
- **[sublime-profile](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/sublime-profile)** — Editor optimization that matters

Every tool scratches a real itch.  
Every tool gets used in production.  
Every tool maintained over time.

## 🎯 What Separates This From Every Other Profile

Most developers:
- ❌ Build for a weekend
- ❌ Get bored
- ❌ Move on
- ❌ Chase frameworks
- ❌ Resume dump their GitHub

**This profile**:
- ✅ **rad-shell**: 41★, thousands of users, **10+ years** of commitment
- ✅ **Temporal depth**: 2011-2026, not riding trends
- ✅ **Early adoption**: Ember & Smoke when they were **risky**
- ✅ **Full spectrum**: PHP → JS → Python → AI → IoT → Hardware
- ✅ **Production code**: Tools people **rely on**, not demos they clone once
- ✅ **Deep understanding**: Framework architecture, not API calls
- ✅ **Sustained evolution**: **Years** of commits, not weeks of excitement

---

## 💼 The Difference

When you see:
- **10+ years**
- **70+ repositories**  
- **Thousands of users**  
- **41 stars on a framework**

You're not seeing someone who starts projects.  

You're seeing someone who **finishes them**, **maintains them**, **evolves them**, and **never stops caring**.

---

## 🚀 Open for Collaboration

Building the next generation of:

**🤖 AI/ML Systems** — Real integration solving real problems  
**🛠️ Developer Tools** — Tools developers actually want to use  
**🏗️ Architecture** — Scaling with intention, not cargo cult  
**🚀 Innovation** — Creating patterns, not following them

I don't follow trends.  
I **investigate** them.  
**Understand** them.  
**Build** on them.  
**Push beyond** them.
