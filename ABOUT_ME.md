# about 'Me' (aka Brandon Fryslie)

I'm typically a private person when it comes to the internet.  IRL - I'm an open book.  But I've been vaguely suspicious
of data retention issues for the last 20 or so years when it comes to sharing personal information online, and I'll tell 
ya, the overall trend of the world at large has not particularly assuaged my concerns.  I will generally keep it private.

I try to avoid falling into the trap of overconfidence or thinking I'm always right.  Being right 99 times in a row doesn't
necessarily mean you'll be right that 100th time (but for the record, I was).  I also have a particularly dry, but active, 
sense of humor.  I always try to keep an open mind (or, possibly more accurately, I always try to always try) and stay humble.
"If you're green, you're growing.  If you're ripe, you're rotten."  I'd rather be green for the rest of my life than reach
my peak and having nothing but decline ahead.

What am I trying to say?  Well, to work with an excellent, top-tier team, I need to sell myself.  I'd prefer it if I could
telepathically broadcast the extent of my skills, my knowledge, my experience, the nuances of my philosophies, the drive to
push for right and best in engineering, in interpersonal relationships, and in my own life.  My sense of humor, my empathy,
and all the rest of those varied qualities, from the obvious and immutable to the subtle and indefinable, those ephemera 
that make a person a truly differentiated individual.

In the likely scenario that no one has any clue what I'm saying:  I am gifted and have many talents.  Not only that, I'm
highly skilled, have deep and varied experience, AND have a good head on my shoulders.  I am incredibly empathetic and can (and do) put myself in others' shoes
and learn from other perspectives.  

I strongly dislike talking about myself like that, and you'll never hear my say those things as a coworker.  But as a candidate?
If this is what it takes to achieve the best outcome, I will do it.  Marketing is really the art of explaining to people how
you'll both benefit from a future relationship (you, the consumer, and me, the product).  After all, anyone have bought an iPod
if it weren't for those dancing shadows?  Hard to say.  But the truth is, people loved the iPod once they had it.  The marketing
was just the nudge to get them to make the decision Apple knew would be best for everyone involved.  Well, I'm your iPod, and
this document is my dancing shadow.

I once said to someone, "Don't take anything I say too seriously."  To avoid another misinterpretation, I am going to say direcrly 

Once I said to someone, "Don't take anything I say too seriously".
I am fond of multiple layers of meaning.  I enjoy attempting to excavate those profound kernels of truth which so often seem to
glitter half buried beneath the ironic and the unserious and the crass and unpretentious.  

.  I am a team player, and
I am in it to win it for the team, not only myself.

I have qualities that are useful and appreciated. 

I would like you to understand that, and believe it, and feel it.  And
then ideally 

define us as individuals.  But alas, telepathy won't be a standard feature
until iPhone '39 (in 2029 Apple switches to a year-based numbering system) and so I must use this medium to sketch out a pale
reflection of myself.
