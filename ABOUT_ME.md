# About 'Me' (aka Brandon Fryslie)

I'm typically a private person when it comes to the internet. IRL — I'm an open book. But I've been vaguely suspicious of data retention issues for the last 20 or so years when it comes to sharing personal information online, and I'll tell ya, the overall trend of the world at large has not particularly assuaged my concerns. I will generally keep it private.

I try to avoid falling into the trap of overconfidence or thinking I'm always right. Being right 99 times in a row doesn't necessarily mean you'll be right that 100th time (but for the record, I was). I also have a particularly dry, but active, sense of humor. I always try to keep an open mind (or, possibly more accurately, I always try to always try) and stay humble. "If you're green, you're growing. If you're ripe, you're rotten." I'd rather be green for the rest of my life than reach my peak and have nothing but decline ahead.

What am I trying to say? Well, to work with an excellent, top-tier team, I need to sell myself. I'd prefer it if I could telepathically broadcast the extent of my skills, my knowledge, my experience, the nuances of my philosophies, the drive to push for right and best in engineering, in interpersonal relationships, and in my own life. My sense of humor, my empathy, and all the rest of those varied qualities, from the obvious and immutable to the subtle and indefinable, those ephemera that make a person a truly differentiated individual.

In the likely scenario that no one has any clue what I'm saying: I am gifted and have many talents. Not only that, I'm highly skilled, have deep and varied experience, AND have a good head on my shoulders. I am incredibly empathetic and can (and do) put myself in others' shoes and learn from other perspectives.

I strongly dislike talking about myself like that, and you'll never hear me say those things as a coworker. But as a candidate? If this is what it takes to achieve the best outcome, I will do it. Marketing is really the art of explaining to people how you'll both benefit from a future relationship (you, the consumer, and me, the product). After all, would anyone have bought an iPod if it weren't for those dancing shadows? Hard to say. But the truth is, people loved the iPod once they had it. The marketing was just the nudge to get them to make the decision Apple knew would be best for everyone involved. Well, I'm your iPod, and this document is my dancing shadow.

## What I've Built

I once said to someone, "Don't take anything I say too seriously." I am fond of multiple layers of meaning. I enjoy attempting to excavate those profound kernels of truth which so often seem to glitter half-buried beneath the ironic and the unserious and the crass and unpretentious.

I've built [rad-shell](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/rad-shell), a Zsh framework that 40+ people have starred and used daily for years. I've built [Tesseract](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/tesseract-react), a kinetic LED sculpture control system that combined React, Java, and physical hardware. I've built [oscilla-animator-v2](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/oscilla-animator-v2), an animation compiler with a custom type system. I've built [ptydriver](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/ptydriver) for programmatic terminal automation, [browsergeist](https://github.com/brandon-fryslie/browsergeist) for "scary real UI automation," and dozens of other tools across terminal systems, LED art, and AI tooling.

I am a team player, and I am in it to win it for the team, not only myself. I have qualities that are useful and appreciated. I would like you to understand that, and believe it, and feel it.

And then ideally, we can skip the telepathy requirement (won't be a standard feature until iPhone '39 — in 2029 Apple switches to a year-based numbering system) and just work together.
